# Optimization-Algorithms-Bias-and-Accuracy-Tradeoffs

## **Description:**
Machine learning models are typically trained using gradient-based optimization methods that aim to maximize predictive accuracy. However, improving accuracy alone can result in models that perform unevenly across different demographic or social groups, raising concerns about fairness. A key challenge in responsible machine learning is understanding the trade-off between fairness and accuracy, particularly how optimization choices influence this balance.


Experiments will be conducted on datasets from multiple application domains, including healthcare outcomes and at least one non-healthcare dataset (e.g., sentiment analysis or income prediction). The expected outcome is a set of empirical results and visualizations that illustrate fairness–accuracy trade-offs under different optimization settings, providing practical insights into how model designers can balance ethical considerations with model effectiveness in real-world applications.

## Datasets
- **Healthcare:** UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- **Non-Healthcare:** UCI Adult Income Dataset
