# Optimization-Algorithms-Bias-and-Accuracy-Tradeoffs

Description: Machine learning models are typically trained using gradient-based optimization methods that aim to maximize predictive accuracy. However, improving accuracy alone can result in models that perform unevenly across different demographic or social groups, raising concerns about fairness. A key challenge in responsible machine learning is understanding the trade-off between fairness and accuracy, particularly how optimization choices influence this balance.
