    "# Optimization of Fairness–Accuracy Trade-offs in Gradient-Based Classification Models\n",

    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning classification models are commonly trained using gradient-based optimization techniques with the primary goal of maximizing predictive accuracy. However, focusing only on accuracy can cause the model to perform better for some demographic groups than others, which can be unfair and raise ethical concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates the **trade-off between predictive accuracy and fairness** in gradient-based classification models by introducing fairness-aware regularization during training. The study focuses on how optimization parameters such as learning rate, training duration, and fairness regularization strength influence both accuracy and group fairness metrics.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. How do fairness constraints affect predictive accuracy in gradient-based classifiers?\n",
    "2. How do optimization parameters influence the fairness–accuracy trade-off?\n",
    "3. Are fairness effects consistent across different application domains/groups?\n",
